# Peco

The code is a mess but it works pretty well now.

## What is this?

A static website generator powered by modern web tooling, like webpack, Vue.js and maybe React someday.

## How is it?

It is good. I don't think I'll ever use Hexo again.

## Installation

Not yet available on npm, just `yarn add egojump/peco --dev` for now.

## How to use?

No docs yet but let me explain how to use it in 20 words:

- `source/*.md` is your pages
- `source/_posts/*.md` is your posts
- `peco dev [directory]` to run it
- `peco build [directory]` to build it

There're many more features though ðŸ˜…

Documentations are coming soon.. (hopefully on May 1st)

## Contribute?

Find bugs, spread the words, share your ideas.
