## What is this?

Peco is a static website generator powered by modern web tooling, like webpack and Vue.js. It generates static HTML files and assets at build time, once the generated website is loaded on the client-side, it runs as an SPA.

## How is it?

It is good. I don't think I'll ever use Hexo again.

## Installation

Not yet available on npm, just `yarn add egojump/peco` for now.

We will officially release it on __May 1st__.

## How to use?

No docs yet but let me explain how to use it in 20 words:

- `source/*.md` is your pages
- `source/_posts/*.md` is your posts
- `peco dev [directory]` to run it
- `peco build [directory]` to build it

There're many more features though ðŸ˜…

Documentations will be available when it's officially released...
